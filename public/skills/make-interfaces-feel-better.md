# Details that make interfaces feel better

Great interfaces rarely come from a single thing. It is usually a collection of small details that compound into a great experience. Before changing anything, detect the project's existing styling and motion systems and express the fix in those systems. Never introduce a second styling system for a polish pass.

For motion work, inspect the interface at 10% speed in browser animation tooling and walk default, hover, focus-visible, active, loading, empty, disabled, and reduced-motion states. A full-speed happy-path replay is not sufficient proof.

## Quick Reference

| Category | When to Use |
| --- | --- |
| [Typography](typography.md) | Text wrapping, font smoothing, tabular numbers |
| [Surfaces](surfaces.md) | Border radius, optical alignment, shadows, image outlines, hit areas |
| [Animations](animations.md) | Interruptible animations, enter/exit transitions, icon animations, scale on press |
| [Icons](icons.md) | Optical weight, one SVG across states, render-size checks, RTL behavior |
| [Performance](performance.md) | Transition specificity, `will-change` usage |

## Core Principles

### 1. Concentric Border Radius

Outer radius = inner radius + padding. Mismatched radii on nested elements is the most common thing that makes interfaces feel off.

### 2. Optical Over Geometric Alignment

When geometric centering looks off, align optically. Buttons with icons, play triangles, and asymmetric icons all need manual adjustment.

### 3. Shadows for Elevation, Borders for Structure

Use layered transparent shadows for elevation. Keep borders when they communicate structure or state: dividers, layout boundaries, selection, and focus.

### 4. Interruptible Animations

Use CSS transitions for interactive state changes — they can be interrupted mid-animation. Reserve keyframes for staged sequences that run once.

### 5. Split and Stagger Enter Animations

For infrequent staged entrances where sequence clarifies hierarchy, split semantic chunks and stagger by about 100ms. Do not stagger routine, high-frequency interactions.

### 6. Subtle Exit Animations

Use a small fixed `translateY` instead of full height. Exits should be softer than enters.

### 7. Contextual Icon Animations

Animate icons with `opacity`, `scale`, and `blur` instead of toggling visibility. Use exactly these values: scale from `0.25` to `1`, opacity from `0` to `1`, blur from `4px` to `0px`. If the project has `motion` or `framer-motion` in `package.json`, use `transition: { type: "spring", duration: 0.3, bounce: 0 }` — bounce must always be `0`. If no motion library is installed, keep both icons in the DOM (one absolute-positioned) and cross-fade with CSS transitions using `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` — this gives both enter and exit animations without any dependency.

### 8. Font Smoothing

Apply `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` to the root layout on macOS for crisper text.

### 9. Tabular Numbers

Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for any dynamically updating numbers to prevent layout shift.

### 10. Text Wrapping

Use `text-wrap: balance` on headings. Use `text-wrap: pretty` for body text to avoid orphans.

### 11. Image Outlines

Add a subtle `1px` outline with low opacity to images for consistent depth. Use untinted black in light mode and untinted white in dark mode unless the brand system explicitly requires another neutral; colored outlines make media feel muddy.

### 12. Scale on Press

A subtle `scale(0.96)` on click gives buttons tactile feedback. Always use `0.96`. Never use a value smaller than `0.95` — anything below feels exaggerated. Add a `static` prop to disable it when motion would be distracting.

### 13. Skip Animation on Page Load

Use `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` to prevent enter animations on first render. Verify it doesn't break intentional entrance animations.

### 14. Never Use `transition: all`

Always specify exact properties: `transition-property: scale, opacity`. Tailwind's `transition-transform` covers `transform, translate, scale, rotate`.

### 15. Use `will-change` Sparingly

Only for `transform`, `opacity`, `filter` — properties the GPU can composite. Never use `will-change: all`. Only add when you notice first-frame stutter.

### 16. Minimum Hit Area

Interactive elements need at least 44×44px hit area on touch/mobile surfaces and at least 40×40px on precise-pointer desktop surfaces. Extend with a pseudo-element if the visible element is smaller. Never let hit areas of two elements overlap.

### 17. Visible State Matrix

For compact controls, verify every interactive state: default, hover, pressed, active/selected, focus-visible, disabled, and loading. The visible glyph can stay small, but the active state and hit target must be obvious in screenshots and browser inspection.

### 18. Motion Restraint

Do not add custom animation to high-frequency interactions. Motion must never be the only feedback channel; pair it with a static change such as color, icon, label, or position, and provide a reduced-motion result.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Same border radius on parent and child | Calculate `outerRadius = innerRadius + padding` |
| Icons look off-center | Adjust optically with padding or fix SVG directly |
| Hard borders between sections | Use layered `box-shadow` with transparency |
| Jarring enter/exit animations | Split, stagger, and keep exits subtle |
| Numbers cause layout shift | Apply `tabular-nums` |
| Heavy text on macOS | Apply `antialiased` to root |
| Animation plays on page load | Add `initial={false}` to `AnimatePresence` |
| `transition: all` on elements | Specify exact properties |
| First-frame animation stutter | Add `will-change: transform` (sparingly) |
| Tiny hit areas on small controls | Extend with pseudo-element to 44×44px on touch or 40×40px on desktop |
| Compact control state is ambiguous | Show default, hover, pressed, active, focus, disabled, and loading states |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Nested rounded elements use concentric border radius
- [ ] Icons are optically centered, not just geometrically
- [ ] Shadows used instead of borders where appropriate
- [ ] Enter animations are split and staggered
- [ ] Exit animations are subtle
- [ ] Dynamic numbers use tabular-nums
- [ ] Font smoothing is applied
- [ ] Headings use text-wrap: balance
- [ ] Images have subtle outlines
- [ ] Buttons use scale on press where appropriate
- [ ] AnimatePresence uses `initial={false}` for default-state elements
- [ ] No `transition: all` — only specific properties
- [ ] `will-change` only on transform/opacity/filter, never `all`
- [ ] Interactive elements have at least 44×44px touch or 40×40px desktop hit area
- [ ] Compact controls show default/hover/pressed/active/focus/disabled/loading states
